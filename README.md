# Smart Bin

This project was developed during the 2019 Internet of Things Course at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it).
It is sometimes difficult to know where to put the different types of waste (metal, plastic, paper, etc.)

The aim of this project is to design a smart automatic recycling trash bin, and it is an interesting solution to a before-mentioned inconvenience that comes from recycling metal and other types of waste. By using this, we hope that the convenience of a recycling trash bin that helps users to sort the trash will inspire more people to recycle.

Smart bin offers following conveniences:

-Being able to sort metal waste with an automatic lid for ease of use -Assigning credits for correct sorting through an Android application automated with NFC sensor.
