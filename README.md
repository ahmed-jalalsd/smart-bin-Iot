Smart trash bin project for iot course 

Final project for iot course at La Sapienza university

It is sometimes difficult to know where to put the different types of waste (metal, plastic, paper, etc.)

This project is to design a smart automatic recycling trash bin, and it is an interesting solution to a before-mentioned inconvenience that comes from recycling metal and other types of waste. By using this, we hope that the convenience of a recycling trash bin that helps users to sort the trash will inspire more people o recycle.

Smart bin offers following conveniences:

Being able to sort metal waste
Automatic lid for ease of use
Assigning credits for correct sorting
